#create unrelated subjects list
create_unrelated_sets.ipynb - using merged_sorted_r277all_n897_2_4_2021.csv creates 3 sets of unrelated subjects:
merged_sorted_r277_unrelated_setA_n387.csv - main analysis set
merged_sorted_r277_unrelated_setB_n305.csv - secondary analysis set (maybe validation?)
merged_sorted_r277_unrelated_setC_n160.csv - tertiary analysis - dont forsee use for this yet

** subjects 179548 and 650746 were initially placed in setA and do NOT have resting state processed data, or MSMALL structural. 
** removing these two subjects manually from merged_sorted_r277_unrelated_setA_n387.csv to create:
merged_sorted_r277_unrelated_setA_n385.csv - main analysis set (2021-03-12)

setAlist.csv - first column (subject id column) of merged_sorted_r277_unrelated_setA_n385.csv, made manually w copypaste just for download subject lists
